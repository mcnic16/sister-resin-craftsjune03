    <p>What is a Resin Coaster?</p>
    <p>The resin is poured into a mold to make a coaster. The coaster helps to protect your tables when placing
        glasses or cups onto them.</p>
    <p>We use a heat resistant epoxy resin and include care instructions with every purchase.</p>
    <p>Coasters should be kept away from harsh cleaning products/chemicals and direct heat.</p>
